# Gratify App

## Objective
The *Gratify* app is a mobile application that helps users manage tasks and daily goals using a structured and dynamic interface. The objective of this project was to build a user-friendly mobile task management app while following Android's MVVM architecture, incorporating key technologies such as Coroutines, LiveData, and Room for local data persistence. This project was designed to strengthen my mobile development skills and provide a solid foundation in building scalable, maintainable mobile applications.

### Skills Learned

- Proficient use of the MVVM architectural pattern for clean and maintainable code.
- Mastery of Kotlin Coroutines for handling asynchronous tasks efficiently.
- Effective use of LiveData for data-binding and UI updates.
- Experience with Room database for local data storage and persistence.
- Implementation of dynamic UI updates based on data changes.
- Integration of Bottom Sheet Dialog for intuitive user interactions.

### Tools Used

- **Kotlin** for writing clean and concise code.
- **Android Jetpack (ViewModel, LiveData, Room)** for implementing MVVM, data-binding, and local data storage.
- **Kotlin Coroutines** for asynchronous data handling.
- **RecyclerView** for displaying dynamic lists of tasks.
- **Bottom Sheet Dialog** for creating smooth, intuitive interactions and allowing users to quickly add or edit tasks.
- **Room Database** for local storage and persistence of task data.

## Features

1. **Task Management:** Users can create, update, and delete tasks, with all changes being dynamically reflected in the UI.
2. **MVVM Architecture:** The app follows the MVVM pattern, ensuring clean separation between the UI and business logic.
3. **Coroutines and LiveData:** Asynchronous task handling with Kotlin Coroutines and LiveData ensures smooth and responsive UI updates.
4. **Bottom Sheet Dialog:** Used for task creation and editing, providing a seamless and non-intrusive user experience.
5. **Local Data Persistence:** Room database is used for persisting task data locally, ensuring that tasks are saved even when the app is closed.


## Steps
1. Install the required Android dependencies such as Kotlin, Android Jetpack libraries (ViewModel, LiveData, Room).
2. Set up the project following the MVVM architecture pattern.
3. Implement the task management features with proper UI-binding using LiveData.
4. Integrate local data storage using Room, ensuring data persistence.
5. Build the Bottom Sheet Dialog for task creation and editing to provide a smooth user experience.
